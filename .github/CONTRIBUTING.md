## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

To set up your local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Fill in your API keys
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

### Branch Naming Convention

Branch names should reflect their purpose and content. Examples:
- `feature/new-feature-name`
- `bugfix/issue-number-description`
- `hotfix/critical-bug-fix`

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Rebase on main** before submitting
- **Ensure tests pass**
- **Keep commits small and focused**
- **Write clear commit messages**
- **Avoid force-pushing** unless necessary
- **Address feedback promptly**

### Coding Standards

- **JavaScript/React**: Follow the existing code style
- **Naming**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components
- **Comments**: Write meaningful comments for complex logic
- **Commits**: Use conventional commit messages

#### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(search): add debounced search functionality
fix(api): handle network errors gracefully
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage

```bash
# Run tests (when implemented)
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Check test coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Code Review Process

1. All submissions require review
2. We may suggest changes, improvements, or alternatives
3. Make requested changes and push to your branch
4. Re-request review when ready
5. Once approved, merge into main
