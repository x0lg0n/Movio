We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds and identities.

## Our Standards
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainers at security@movio.dev. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
